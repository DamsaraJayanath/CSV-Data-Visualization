The results are visualized with a horizontal bar chart using Matplotlib.

Key Features:
<ul>
<li>Uses Pandas for data manipulation and reading CSV files.</li>
<li>Leverages Counter from the collections module to count programming language occurrences.</li>
<li>Visualizes the top 10 most common programming languages in a clean Matplotlib bar chart.</li></ul>
